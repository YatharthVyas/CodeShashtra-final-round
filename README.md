# CodeShashtra-final-round
### Objective of the project was to maximize the percentage of people legally travelling through trains.
## Ideas -
### To generate a QRCode for every ticket noting the Departutre and arrival station. While exit, it will be scanned. People with no ticket or ticket not permitting the distance travelled would be fined.
### To arrange for face recognition of the fined people. If they committ the same thing within 5 months, they could face arrest.
